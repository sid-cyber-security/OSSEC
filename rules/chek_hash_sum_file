//If you only add a path where to check the hash amount, then notifications will not come. You also need to add a rule to local_rules. An example is below.

<rule id="100003" level="7">
    <if_sid>550</if_sid>
    <regex>^opt/your_important_file</regex>   //path to your file
    <description>File modified (hash changed) your_important_file</description>
  </rule>
